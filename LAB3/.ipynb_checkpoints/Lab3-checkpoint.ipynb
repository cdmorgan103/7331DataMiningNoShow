    "A Vicon motion capture camera system was used to record 12 users performing 5 hand postures with markers attached to a left-handed glove. \n",
    "\n",
    "A rigid pattern of markers on the back of the glove was used to establish a local coordinate system for the hand, and 11 other markers were attached to the thumb and fingers of the glove. 3 markers were attached to the thumb with one above the thumbnail and the other two on the knuckles. 2 markers were attached to each finger with one above the fingernail and the other on the joint between the proximal and middle phalanx. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 11 markers not part of the rigid pattern were unlabeled; their positions were not explicitly tracked. Consequently, there is no a priori correspondence between the markers of two given records. In addition, due to the resolution of the capture volume and self-occlusion due to the orientation and configuration of the hand and fingers, many records have missing markers. Extraneous markers were also possible due to artifacts in the Vicon software's marker reconstruction/recording process and other objects in the capture volume. As a result, the number of visible markers in a record varied considerably. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data presented here is already partially preprocessed. First, all markers were transformed to the local coordinate system of the record containing them. Second, each transformed marker with a norm greater than 200 millimeters was pruned. Finally, any record that contained fewer than 3 markers was removed. The processed data has at most 12 markers per record and at least 3. For more information, see 'Attribute Information'. \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the manner in which data was captured, it is likely that for a given record and user there exists a near duplicate record originating from the same user. We recommend therefore to evaluate classification algorithms on a leave-one-user-out basis wherein each user is iteratively left out from training and used as a test set. One then tests the generalization of the algorithm to new users. A 'User' attribute is provided to accomodate this strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset may be used for a variety of tasks, the most obvious of which is posture recognition via classification. One may also attempt user identification. Alternatively, one may perform clustering (constrained or unconstrained) to discover marker distributions either as an attempt to predict marker identities or obtain statistical descriptions/visualizations of the postures.

As described in the business understanding section, this dataset consists of snapshot measurements taken from a special glove fitted with sensors to track a person's hand movements and map them to 3-dimensional space. The dataset has recorded data for up to 11 sensors in each capture (some may have been obscured when measurement was performed), and associated 3D coordinates for each sensor. Captures were taken for 13 users who were performing one of five pre-defined gestures with their hand.\n",

We will begin by performing cluster analysis of all points aggregated together:"

This was done to illustrate that when multiple random samples are plotted in 3-dimensional space, the distributions are different each time but there are similar patterns that can be observed consistently such as 2 large elliptoid clusters on the right side and some smaller clusters on the left side. This provides some anecdotal evidence that clustering may be successful using all available data aggregated from every user and every gesture class."

    "We plot the basic GMM clusters above, both as a static image consisting of all points (more than 600,000) and an interactive plot that is sampled as 20,000 random points from the dataset color-coded by cluster. From these visuals, we can see that there does appear to be decent clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the data description, we know that there are 2 sensors on each finger and 3 sensors on the thumb. We also know that there are several positions in which multiple (sometimes more than half) of the sensors are obscured from view and not recorded. Therefore, this clustering makes sense from a logical perspective, but it could likely still be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting comparison is the distribution of clusters as defined by GMM. While we do not know from the raw data which sensors correspond to which point on the glove, we do know that in a majority of recorded instances there are sensors that were unable to be recorded. It would be interesting to note if this clustering algorithm created clusters of varying sizes, which might be indicative of an uneven distribution of which sensors were not recorded most or least often."

    "This also makes logical sense, since it would be expected that some of the gestures being performed would have obscured at least part of the hand. The distribution shows that from GMM, there are 2 clusters defined that are very scarce in the total (both less than 5%) compared to the rest. This could be accounted for as the 2 sensors present on a finger that is often obscured, such as the pinky finger. Conversely, there are 2 clusters that stand out as about the same percentage as eachother (almost 14%) but both significantly higher than most of the other clusters. These cluster could represent sensors on fingers that are needed to perform most of the gestures recorded, so they might show up regardless of user or class."
