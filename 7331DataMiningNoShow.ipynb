    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "We utilized the Kaggle No Show appointment data that contains the show/no-show status for several clinics across Brazil that are a part of a central healthcare system. The data set has 110,527 records and 14 attributes. This data was collected in 2016 and shows the show/no-show behavior of the patients across the different medical facilities (that are identified as the Neighborhood location).  \n",
    "\n",
    "No Show in the medical world can be a large cost for clinics and health systems. With healthcare institution margins shrinking and an effort to modernize the delivery of healthcare, prioritizing nonproductive time has become a more common focus. As the institution's capacity becomes more constrained and scheduling time frames grow into the weeks, no show is often cited as becoming an increasingly important issue and many medical systems have gone to extreme lengths to reduce these costly occurrences. \n",
    "\n",
    "This has led many institutions to take various actions such as appointment confirmation via SMS, consumer engagement via email/web, strict planned overbooking rates, and even predictive modeling (my healthcare employer has done this).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of predictive modeling, we have to not only think of how much yield our model can reasonably contribute, but we also have to consider the impact of a predicted No-show. Are we going to overbook for predicted no-show patients? If we predict No-show too often and have \"Show patients\", there is the potential for serious ramifications in the form of clinical overload. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that we consider how the model will be utilized and consider being as conservative as possible for no-show prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "As data scientists, it will be critical for us to not only explain model performance, but coach business leaders on how the model will work and be impacted by changes. This means establishing an effective communication channel between business leaders and the Data Science team so impacts of any operational changes (i.e. changing scheduling practices, adding pre-appointment verification calls, etc.) can be communicated. Furthermore, this may mean helping to coach business leaders on how they can use the model and where to put resources to improve business performance (i.e. following up with high probability no-show appointments before their appointment).\n",

    "### Data Meaning\n",
    "This dataset contains 110,527 appointment records for clinics located across the coastal city of Vitória in Espírito Santo, Brazil. The dataset includes 11 meaningful predictors relating to each appointment and to the patient that scheduled that appointment. Unique numeric identifiers are provided for each patient as well as for each appointment. The response variable of interest for this data set, *No-show*, is a boolean variable denoting whether or not a patient made it to their scheduled appointment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the 11 predictor variables (the 2 unique identifiers are excluded), there are 2 timepoints, 1 integer, 1 categorical, and 7 boolean variables. Data are provided that generally describe a patient's health problems as well as their age, gender, and scholastic background. In addition to patient information, we are given data pertaining to the location and time of the appointment as well as whether or not the patient was notified about their appointment with an automated SMS reminder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table describes all the variables provided in greater detail. Perhaps the most intriguing variable is *Scholarship*, which is related to the Bolsa Família social program instituted in Brazil. According to the dataset curator, \"the best explanation about this variable that indicates if the person receives a scholarship or not\" (source: https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments/discussion/45899). Based on this description, we assume that this variable defines whether or not a patient is currently receiving financial aid as part of this social program. Participants in Bolsa Família must have an income of less than $170/month, must attend regular medical checkups for all mothers and children in the household, and children must regularly attend school (source: https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/programa-bolsa-familia).\n",

It is unlikely the 2 patients who are actually 115, but it is feasible to reach this age, and most likely, these patients true age are within the vicinity of the age documented but are slightly off due to poor birth documentation.

    "For part of our effort to provide an example of exceptional work for this project, we decided to create an interactive plot to view the percentage of patients that did not show up for their appointment by each neighborhood location. This plot will exist on a real-scale map of Vitoria - ES, Brazil. This will allow us to make meaningful inferences about distance between clinic neighborhoods since we can view them on a real-life scaled map.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, I leveraged Google Maps Web API and the Bokeh package for creating interactive plots. This requires that a project be registered on Google's API access developer portal using a Google account. Once this was accomplished and an account was properly set up, I received an API key to allow access to Google's Map API from within Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data set contained descriptive names for each of the 81 neighborhoods that clinics are located in, I first used Google's API from within Python to search for the location of each neighborhood on Google Maps. This is accomplished by utilizing Google's Geolocation API with the neighborhood name, and specifying that we are only interested in looking for places around Vitoria - ES, Brazil (this is accomplished by appending ', Vitoria - ES, Brazil' to the end of each neighborhood name). The GeoCode data from Google is stashed in a local pickle file for easy retrieval later without the need to access Google's servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two Neighborhoods are excluded from the search; the names are ambiguous (they describe and industrial park and an ocean respectively), and while Google Maps is able to find a location for each of them, the locations it returns are far away from Vitoria Brazil and likely not accurate. Therefore, these two neighborhoods have been excluded from the plot map."

    "As you can see from the interactive plot above, Bokeh allowed us to create a dynamic, interactive map of the clinic neighborhoods in this data set. I believe this can be very useful for EDA in projects like these, because reading a table of 81 neighborhood names and their corresponding responses doesn't facilitate finding patterns in the data nearly as well as an interactive plot does. The Bokeh plot is fully interactive; it can be zoomed and panned with a mouse to navigate the data in whatever way is the most useful and convenient for the user.\n",

    "This process required extensive trial and error using Pandas and Bokeh to prepare data for plotting and to create the plot, and  work was also done to make the plot aesthetically pleasing by researching Bokeh's options for presenting the plotted data. We believe that the creation of this plot is an example of exceptional work that has been done to improve this project. This work will be useful to our team, and could also be useful as an example and template for other students wishing to create interactive location plots in the future."
